Remove spurious metadata:
 * binstar
 * requires
 * info: {}

Understand more about the following metadata:
 * subdir - is it used? Can we make use of it for on the fly creation of a distribution?

 * size & md5 - what if we don't yet know what this will be. Can it be removed safely?
 


Metadata that needs to be fudged:
 * has_prefix - how can we know? Just say that it always does?
 *
